# GDE9000

Goal: Build tools to assist Slack channel moderators in creating a welcoming, inclusive space for GDEs while supporting community growth and engagement.

### What's with the name of this Repo?
I'm glad you asked. USS Discovery One has a HAL 9000, I thought it only appropriate that GDE had something similar, though slightly less focused on completing the mission at all costs :) But if you have a better name, feel free to make suggestions.

# How to contribute
Contributions from any GDE with a desire to improve community tools are completely welcome. For inspireation, see the list of "How Might We..." questions below or feel free to improve them in this document.

If you have a feature idea, create a rough prototype (code, storyboard, conversation script) using the example structure found in Prototypes/feature-example. If you'd like to contribue working code contact brycehowitson@gmail to get setup.

Once you've added a prototype or improved the documentation, make a Pull Requst on the repo.

## Findings/Solutions from The 2019 Global Summit Design Sprint

- Make setup and organization easier by pulling data from GDE App and Hoteliers
- Suggest contact info, channels to join, people to contact and generate bio info from above data sets
- Create a "points" system to show appreciation and engagement. Points can be gifted to others or awarded for providing reviews, edits, suggestions, etc. Points "may" be a trackable GDE Activity
- Crowdsource event information. This may include tips for what to bring/things to do in various places around the world, suggestions for content or audience types, ride sharing, etc.
